# Chrome_Bookmark_Extension
Bookmark extension for Google Chrome using JavaScript, JQuery, and the Bookmark API

Most pdf readers have a built-in bookmark functionality, but Google Chrome doesn't. With this Chrome extension, you're able to interact with a popup in order to create and manage your bookmarks.

This makes use of Google's Bookmark API, which manages all of the bookmarks in a tree, and employs JavaScript and JQuery in order to interact with the bookmarks. The functionalities are:
- Deleting bookmarks;
- Adding folders (books);
- Adding bookmarks into a folder;
- Searching for bookmarks given an user input
